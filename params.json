It has a daily specials feature that can be updated with ease using a twitter account. It lists all of the coffee based drinks and gives the user a description about the drink selected. \r\n    It can also bring up the stores location in the map app in iOS so the user can get directions to or bookmark the location. For iOS6 I utilized the new social integration features to allow users to tweet or post to facebook directly from the app. It also uses Passbook integration for a customer loyalty discount card.\r\nIf you would like to contact me about projects you can [e-mail](mailto: toddpickell@me.com) me.","name":"GiddyGoatApp","google":"","tagline":"Giddy Goat CoffeeHouse iOS app"}
